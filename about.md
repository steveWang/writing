# About me

I've been a software engineer at Google since 2016. I often describe my job
as complaining about the Internet -- there is some element of truth to
that, as I started on a team that focusued on network measurement and
visibility, and have carried that experience to my more recent endeavors
within the company.

In more recent days, I've started describing my role as "I don't know
anything about the boxes in your system architecture diagrams. I'm just in
charge of the arrows."
